As a User of the FitBoi application
I would like to create a new user profile
So that I can use the application as intended to log my personal goals and track my fitness progress.

Given the User is not currently a member of the the FitBoi application
And the entered email is invalid
When the request to create a profile is made
Then the new User profile is not created
